# CUDA Programming

The purpose of this assignment is to familiarize yourself with CUDA programming.

## Problem Statement

In this problem, you need to use CUDA to parallelize concurrent wave equation `serial_wave.c`.

## Requirements

* The output format should not be changed.
* Your submitted solution contains only one source file, which is named `wave.cu`.
* Your program take two command-line arguments, which indicate the number of points and the number of iterations, respectively.
